## Challenges faced + Lessons Learned

-My first time using XAML
-Writing web apps vs desktop/mobile apps is vastly different especially in rendering of content
-My first time trying to use MVVM instead of MVC , found it hard to properly choose where to place each file
-MAUI apps take a longer time to load and are more error prone
-Hard to find my db file when i created it so I wasn't sure if it was working or not
-I'm not so good with UI design
